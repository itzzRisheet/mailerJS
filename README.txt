** Nodemailer : 
    Here we are using Nodemailer.js library to send mail

    > IMAP and SMTP servers : 
        IMAP is used to retrieve messages, and SMTP is for sending data. 
        IMAP works between the server and client for communication, and 
        SMTP works between servers to transfer information. 
        IMAP allows users to organize emails onto the server, 
        while SMTP allows organizing emails on client storage.

    > first of all we have created a test account withe nodemailer.createTestAccount();
